# Diamond Price Prediction

## Problem Statement
This repository contains a diamond price prediction project for predicting the price of diamonds using the datasets input features : Carat, Depth, Table, x, y, z, Cut, Color and Clarity.

## Data Understanding
We will be predicting prices for the gemstone.csv dataset.

- **Carat represents** the weight of the diamond, and is a numerical variable.<br>
- **Cut represents** the quality of the cut of the diamond, and falls into 5 categories: fair, good, very good, ideal, and premium. In this project, these categories were represented by an ordinal variable, 1-5. You can decide to use the ordinal or categorical variable.<br>
- **Clarity represents** the internal purity of the diamond, and falls into 8 categories: I1, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, and IF (in order from least to most pure). In this project, these categories were represented by an ordinal variable, 1-8. You can decide to use the ordinal or categorical variable.<br>
- **Color represents** the color of the diamond, and is rated D through J, with D being the most colorless (and valuable) and J being the most yellow.

# Dataset Information : 
Available in EDA under the notebooks folder

# Algorithm Used :
This project is a an example of Regression Problem. We have used multiple Regression algorithms and the best algorithm is used for the prediction.


List of models the project uses to train on the dataset -

- Linear Regression
- Lasso
- Ridge
- Elastic Net
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists all the Python libraries and dependencies required to run the project.
  
- `.gitignore`: This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.

- `README.md`: This file is an outcome of displaying the projects documentation.

- `application.py`: This is the Flask application file responsible for hosting the web application.

- `notebooks`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, visualization and model training . The `data` folder within this directory contains the dataset used for this project.

- `setup.py`: This is the setup file for the project, which may include additional configuration settings.

- `src`: This directory contains the source code for the project, organized into several subdirectories and files:
    - `logs`: This directory contains log files generated by the project.
    - `components`: This directory contains Python modules for various project components, including:
        - `data_ingestion.py`: Handles the process of loading and preparing the dataset.
        - `data_transformation.py`: Performs data preprocessing and feature engineering.
        - `model_trainer.py`: Contains code for training and evaluating machine learning models.
    - `pipelines`: This directory contains data processing or machine learning pipelines used in the project, including:
        - `training_pipeline.py`: Defines the training pipeline for model development.
        - `prediction_pipeline.py`: Defines the pipeline for making predictions using the trained model.
    - `exception.py`: Thos file provide a way to create and raise user-defined errors with specific context and messaging, enhancing error handling and code clarity.
    - `logger.py`: This file helps us to record and manage application events and information, facilitating debugging and monitoring.
    - `utils.py`: Contains utility functions used throughout the project.
 
- `artifacts` : This folder contains the train,test and raw csv files along with the preprocessed and best model pickle file.

- `templates` : This folder contains the HTML files used for obtaining user input via form and flask uses these files as a rendering template.
